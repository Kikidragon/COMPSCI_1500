7.22 String formatting using dictionaries
Mapping keys

Sometimes a string contains many conversion specifiers. Such strings can be hard to read and understand. Furthermore, the programmer must be careful with the ordering of the tuple values, lest items are mistakenly swapped. A dictionary may be used in place of a tuple on the right side of the conversion operator to enhance clarity at the expense of brevity. If a dictionary is used, then all conversion specifiers must include a mapping key component. A mapping key is specified by indicating the key of the relevant value in the dictionary within parentheses.

print('Time is: {:02d}/{:02d}/{:04d}  {:02d}:{:02d} {:02d} sec' \
     .format(gmt.tm_mon, gmt.tm_mday, gmt.tm_year, gmt.tm_hour, gmt.tm_min, gmt.tm_sec))

Complete the print statement to produce the given output using mapping keys.
1)
"I need 12 lilies, 6 roses, and 18 tulips."

print ('I need %(lilies)d lilies, %(roses)d roses, and %(tulips)d tulips.' % {})

2)
"My name is Jerome and I'm 15 years old."

print ('My name is %(name)s and I am %(age)d years old' % {})
