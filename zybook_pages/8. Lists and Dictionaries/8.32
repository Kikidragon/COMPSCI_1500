8.32 LAB: Output values below an amount

Write a program that first gets a list of integers from input. The last value of the input represents a threshold. Output all integers less than or equal to that threshold value. Do not include the threshold value in the output.

For simplicity, follow each number output by a comma, including the last one.

Ex: If the input is:

50 60 140 200 75 100

the output is:

50,60,75,

Such functionality is common on sites like Amazon, where a user can filter results.
