8.11 Additional practice: Engineering examples

The following is a sample programming lab activity; not all classes using a zyBook require students to fully complete this activity. No auto-checking is performed. Users planning to fully complete this program may consider first developing their code in a separate programming environment.

A list can be useful in solving various engineering problems. One problem is computing the voltage drop across a series of resistors. If the total voltage across the resistors is V, then the current through the resistors will be I = V/R, where R is the sum of the resistances. The voltage drop Vx across resistor x is then Vx = I Â· Rx.
zyDE 8.11.1: Calculate voltage drops across series of resistors.

The following program uses a list to store a user-entered set of resistance values and computes I.

Modify the program to compute the voltage drop across each resistor, store each in another list voltage_drop, and finally print the results in the following format:

5 resistors are in series.
This program calculates the voltage drop across each resistor.
Input voltage applied to circuit: 12.0
Input ohms of 5 resistors
1) 3.3
2) 1.5
3) 2.0
4) 4.0
5) 2.2
Voltage drop per resistor is
1) 3.0 V
2) 1.4 V
3) 1.8 V
4) 3.7 V
5) 2.0 V


            num_resistors = 5
            resistors = []
            voltage_drop = []


            print(f'{num_resistors} resistors are in the series.')
            print('This program calculates the'),
            print('voltage drop across each resistor.')

            input_voltage = float(input('Input voltage applied to circuit: '))
            print (input_voltage)


            print(f'Input ohms of {num_resistors} resistors')
            for i in range(num_resistors):

                res = float(input('{i + 1})'))
                print(res)
                resistors.append(res)

            #  Calculate current
            current = input_voltage / sum(resistors)

            # Calculate voltage drop over each resistor
            # ....

            # Print the voltage drop per resistor
            # ....




Engineering problems commonly involve matrix representation and manipulation. A matrix can be captured using a two-dimensional list. Then matrix operations can be defined on such lists.
zyDE 8.11.2: Matrix multiplication of 4x2 and 2x3 matrices.

The following illustrates matrix multiplication for 4x2 and 2x3 matrices captured as two-dimensional lists.

Run the program below. Try changing the size and value of the matrices and computing new values.

            num_resistors = 5
            resistors = []
            voltage_drop = []


            print(f'{num_resistors} resistors are in the series.')
            print('This program calculates the'),
            print('voltage drop across each resistor.')

            input_voltage = float(input('Input voltage applied to circuit: '))
            print (input_voltage)


            print(f'Input ohms of {num_resistors} resistors')
            for i in range(num_resistors):

                res = float(input('{i + 1})'))
                print(res)
                resistors.append(res)

            #  Calculate current
            current = input_voltage / sum(resistors)

            # Calculate voltage drop over each resistor
            # ....

            # Print the voltage drop per resistor
            # ....
