8.28 LAB: Remove all even numbers from a list

Write the remove_evens() function, which receives a list of integers as a parameter and returns a new list of integers containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The main program outputs values of the returned list.

Hint: If the original list has even numbers, then the new list will be smaller in length than the original list and should have no blank elements.

Ex: If the list passed to the remove_evens() function is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], then the function returns and the program output is:

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Ex: If the list passed to the remove_evens() function is [1, 9, 3], then the function returns and the program output is:

[1, 9, 3]
