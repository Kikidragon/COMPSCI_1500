8.31 LAB: Adjust list by normalizing

When analyzing data sets, such as data for human heights or for human weights, a common step is to adjust the data. This adjustment can be done by normalizing to values between 0 and 1, or throwing away outliers.

For this program, read in a list of floats and adjust their values by dividing all values by the largest value. Output each value with two digits after the decimal point. Follow each number output by a space.

Ex: If the input is:

30.0 50.0 10.0 100.0 65.0

the output is:

0.30 0.50 0.10 1.00 0.65
