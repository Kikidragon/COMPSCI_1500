8.29 LAB: Adjust list by normalizing - functions

When analyzing data sets, such as data for human heights or for human weights, a common step is to adjust the data. This can be done by normalizing to values between 0 and 1, or throwing away outliers. For this program, adjust the values by subtracting the smallest value from all the values. Input values should be added to the list until -1 is entered.

Ex: If the input is:

30
50
10
70
65
-1

the output is:

20
40
0
60
55

Your program must define and call the function:
get_minimum_int(nums)
