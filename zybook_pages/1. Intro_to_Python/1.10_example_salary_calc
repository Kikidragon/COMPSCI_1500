1.10 Python example: Salary calculation

This section contains a very basic example for starters; the examples increase in size and complexity in later sections.
zyDE 1.10.1: Executing Python code using the interpreter.

The following program calculates yearly and monthly salary given an hourly wage. The program assumes a work-hours-per-week of 40 and work-weeks-per-year of 50.

hourly_wage = 20

print('Annual salary is: ')
print(hourly_wage * 40 * 50)
print()

print('Monthly salary is: ')
print(((hourly_wage * 40 * 50) / 1))
print()

#        the 1 so that the statement
#        outputs monthly salary.






    Insert the correct number in the code below to print a monthly salary. Then run the program. The monthly salary should be 3333.333... .
