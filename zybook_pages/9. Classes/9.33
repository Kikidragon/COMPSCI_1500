9.33 LAB: Count probations

Students are put on probation if their GPA is below 2.0. Complete the Course class by implementing the count_probation() instance method, which returns the number of students with a GPA below 2.0.

The file main.py contains:

    The main function for testing the program.
    Class Course represents a course, which contains a list of Student objects as a course roster. (Type your code in here.)
    Class Student represents a classroom student, which has three attributes: first name, last name, and GPA.

Hint: Refer to the Student class to explore the available instance methods that can be used for implementing the count_probation() method.

Note: For testing purposes, different student values will be used.

Ex. For the following students:

Henry Cabot 3.2
Brenda Stern 1.1
Lynda Robison 2.4
Jane Flynn 1.8

the output is:

Probation count: 2
