9.36 LAB: Swap two numbers

Complete the swap() method to exchange the values of the num attribute of two Number objects, num1 and num2.

Hint: Refer to the given Number class to see the definitions of num attribute and other instance methods available.

Ex: If num1 is 19 and num2 is 178, calling swap(num1, num2) will swap the values so that num1 becomes 178 and num2 becomes 19.
