9.28 LAB: What is the dice total?

Given a GVDie object and an integer that represents the number of rolls as parameters, complete function roll_specific_times(). The function roll_specific_times() should calculate and return the running sum of rolling the die the given number of times.

Note: For testing purposes, a GVDie object is created in the main() function using a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed value. The program uses a seed value of 15 during development, but when submitted, a different seed value will be used for each test case. Refer to the textbook section on Random numbers to learn more about pseudo-random numbers.

Ex: If the GVDie object is created with a seed value of 15 and the input of the program is:

100

the output is:

100 rolls return a total of 330.
