9.31 LAB: Rolling for X

Complete function roll_specific_number() that has three parameters: a GVDie object, an integer representing a desired face number of a die, and an integer representing the goal amount of times to roll the desired face number. The function roll_specific_number() then rolls the die until the desired face number is rolled the goal amount of times and returns the number of rolls required.

Note: For testing purposes, a GVDie object is created in the main() function using a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed value. The program uses a seed value of 15 during development, but when submitted, a different seed value will be used for each test case. Refer to the textbook section on Random numbers to learn more about pseudo-random numbers.

Ex: If a GVDie object is created with a seed value of 15 and the input of the program is:

3
20

the output is:

It took 101 rolls to get a "3" 20 times.
