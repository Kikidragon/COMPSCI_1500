9.23 LAB: How many dice rolls?

Given a GVDie object and an integer that represents the total sum desired as parameters, complete function roll_total() that returns the number of rolls needed to achieve at least the total sum.

Note: For testing purposes, the GVDie object is created in the main() function using a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed value. The program uses a seed value of 15 during development, but when submitted, a different seed value will be used for each test case. Refer to the textbook section on random numbers to learn more about pseudo-random numbers.

Ex: If the GVDie object is created with a seed value of 15 and the input of the program is:

20

the output is:

Number of rolls to reach at least 20: 8
