9.29 LAB: Dean's list

Students make the Dean's list if their GPA is 3.5 or higher. Complete the Course class by implementing the get_deans_list() instance method, which returns a list of students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher.

The file main.py contains:

    The main function for testing the program.
    Class Course represents a course, which contains a list of student objects as a course roster. (Type your code in here.)
    Class Student represents a classroom student, which has three attributes: first name, last name, and GPA. (Hint: get_gpa() returns a student's GPA.)

Note: For testing purposes, different student values will be used.

Ex. For the following students:

Henry Nguyen 3.5
Brenda Stern 2.0
Lynda Robison 3.2
Sonya King 3.9

the output is:

Dean's list:
Henry Nguyen (GPA: 3.5)
Sonya King (GPA: 3.9)
