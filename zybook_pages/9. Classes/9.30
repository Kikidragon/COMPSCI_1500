9.30 LAB: Drop student

Complete the Course class by implementing the drop_student() instance method, which removes a student (by last name) from the course roster. If the student is not found in the course roster, no student should be dropped.

The file main.py contains:

    The main function for testing the program.
    Class Course represents a course, which contains a list of Student objects as a course roster. (Type your code in here.)
    Class Student represents a classroom student, which has three attributes: first name, last name, and GPA. (Hint: get_last() returns the last name field.)

Note: For testing purposes, different student values will be used.

Ex. For the following students:

Henry Nguyen 3.5
Brenda Stern 2.0
Lynda Robison 3.2
Sonya King 3.9

the output for dropping Stern is:

Course size: 4 students
Course size after drop: 3 students
