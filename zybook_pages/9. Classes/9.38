9.38 LAB: Find the maximum in a list

Complete the find_max() instance method in the Numbers class that returns the largest value in list nums.

Ex: If the list is:

[331, 970, 154, 404, 666, 49, 74, 840, 548, 96]

the output is:

[331, 970, 154, 404, 666, 49, 74, 840, 548, 96]
970

Note: During development, list nums is filled with 10 pseudo-random integers in main() using the fill_randomly() instance method from the Numbers class with a seed value of 7. When submitted, different seed values will be used to generate lists of different size for the test cases. Refer to the textbook section on Random numbers to learn more about pseudo-random numbers.
