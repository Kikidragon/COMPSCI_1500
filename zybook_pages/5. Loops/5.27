5.27 LAB: Output numbers in reverse

Write a program that reads a list of integers, one per line, until an * is read, then outputs those integers in reverse. For simplicity in coding output, follow each integer, including the last one, by a comma.

Note: Use a while loop to output the integers. DO NOT use reverse() or reversed().

Ex: If the input is:

2
4
6
8
10
*

the output is:

10,8,6,4,2,
