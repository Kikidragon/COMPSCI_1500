10.7 LAB: Fat-burning heart rate

Write a program that calculates an adult's fat-burning heart rate, which is 70% of 220 minus the person's age. Complete fat_burning_heart_rate() to calculate the fat burning heart rate.

The adult's age must be between the ages of 18 and 75 inclusive. If the age entered is not in this range, raise a ValueError exception in get_age() with the message "Invalid age." Handle the exception in __main__ and print the ValueError message along with "Could not calculate heart rate info."

Ex: If the input is:

35

the output is:

Fat burning heart rate for a 35 year-old: 129.5 bpm

If the input is:

17

the output is:

Invalid age.
Could not calculate heart rate info.
