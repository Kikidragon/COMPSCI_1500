2.6 Python expressions

Below is a simple program that includes an expression involving integers.
Figure 2.6.1: Expression example: Leasing cost.

""" Computes the total cost of leasing a car given the down payment,
    monthly rate, and number of months """

down_payment = int(input('Enter down payment: '))
payment_per_month = int(input('Enter monthly payment: '))
num_months = int(input('Enter number of months: '))

total_cost = down_payment + (payment_per_month * num_months)

print ('Total cost:', total_cost)



Enter down payment: 500
Enter monthly payment: 300
Enter number of months: 60
Total cost: 18500

2.6.1: Simple program with an arithmetic expression.

Consider the example above.
1)
Would removing the parentheses as below have yielded the same result?

down_payment + payment_per_month * num_months

2)
Would using two assignment statements as below have yielded the same result?

all_months_cost = payment_per_month * num_months
total_cost = down_payment + all_months_cost

Style: Single space around operators

A good practice is to include a single space around operators for readability, as in num_items + 2, rather than num_items+2. An exception is minus used as negative, as in: x_coordinate = -y_coordinate. Minus (-) used as negative is known as unary minus.

2.6.2: Single space around operators.

Retype each statement to follow the good practice of a single space around operators.

Note: If an answer is marked wrong, something differs in the spacing, spelling, capitalization, etc. This activity emphasizes the importance of such details.
1)
houses_city = houses_block *10

2)
total = num1+num2+2

3)
num_balls=num_balls+1

4)
num_entries = (user_val+1)*2

Compound operators

Special operators called compound operators provide a shorthand way to update a variable, such as age += 1 being shorthand for age = age + 1. Other compound operators include -=, *=, /=, and %=.
Table 2.6.1: Compound operators.
Compound operator 	Expression with compound operator 	Equivalent expression
Addition assignment 	age += 1 	age = age + 1
Subtraction assignment 	age -= 1 	age = age - 1
Multiplication assignment 	age *= 1 	age = age * 1
Division assignment 	age /= 1 	age = age / 1
Modulo (operator further discussed elsewhere) assignment 	age %= 1 	age = age % 1

2.6.3: Compound operators.
1)
num_atoms is initially 7. What is num_atoms after:
num_atoms += 5?

2)
num_atoms is initially 7. What is num_atoms after:
num_atoms *= 2?

3)
Rewrite the statement using a compound operator, or type: Not possible
car_count = car_count / 2

4)
Rewrite the statement using a compound operator, or type: Not possible
num_items = box_count + 1

No commas allowed

Commas are not allowed in an integer literal. So 1,333,555 is written as 1333555.

2.6.4: Assigning an integer literal.
1)
The following code correctly assigns num_years with an integer value of 2 billion.

num_years = 2,000,000,000

2.6.3: Acceleration of gravity.
Compute the approximate acceleration of gravity for an object above the earth's surface, assigning accel_gravity with the result. The expression for the acceleration of gravity is: (G * M) / (d 2), where G is the gravitational constant 6.673 x 10-11, M is the mass of the earth 5.98 x 1024 (in kg), and d is the distance in meters from the Earth's center (stored in variable dist_center).

Sample output with input: 6.3782e6 (100 m above the Earth's surface at the equator)

Acceleration of gravity: 9.81
