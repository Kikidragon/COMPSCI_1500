2.20 LAB: Pizza party

Given the number of people attending a pizza party, output the number of needed pizzas and total cost. For the calculation, assume that people eat 2 slices on average and each pizza has 12 slices and costs $14.95.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print('Cost: ${:.2f}'.format(cost))

Hint: Use the ceil() function from the math module to round up the number of pizzas so that enough pizzas are ordered.

Ex: If the input is:

4

the output is:

Pizzas: 1
Cost: $14.95
