2.19 LAB: Convert from seconds

People find it easier to read time in hours, minutes, and seconds rather than just seconds.

Write a program that reads in seconds as input, and outputs the time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Ex: If the input is:

4000

the output is:

Hours: 1
Minutes: 6
Seconds: 40
