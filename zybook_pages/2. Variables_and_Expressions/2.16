2.16 LAB: Musical note frequencies

On a piano, a key has a frequency, say f0. Each higher key (black or white) has a frequency of f0 * rn, where n is the distance (number of keys) from that key, and r is 2(1/12). Given an initial key frequency, output that frequency and the next 4 higher key frequencies.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print('{:.2f} {:.2f} {:.2f} {:.2f} {:.2f}'.format(your_value1, your_value2, your_value3, your_value4, your_value5))

Ex: If the input is:

440

(which is the A key near the middle of a piano keyboard), the output is:

440.00 466.16 493.88 523.25 554.37

Note: Use one statement to compute r = 2(1/12) using the pow function (remember to import the math module). Then use that r in subsequent statements that use the formula fn = f0 * rn with n being 1, 2, 3, and finally 4.
