2.21 LAB: Hypotenuse

Given two numbers that represent the lengths of a right triangle's legs (sides adjacent to the right angle), output the length of the third side (i.e. hypotenuse) with two digits after the decimal point.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print('Hypotenuse: {:.2f}'.format(c))

Ex: If the input is:

3.0
4.0

the output is:

Hypotenuse: 5.00
