6.24 LAB: Miles to track laps

One lap around a standard high-school running track is exactly 0.25 miles. Write the function miles_to_laps() that takes a number of miles as an argument and returns the number of laps. Complete the program to output the number of laps.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print('{:.2f}'.format(your_value))

Ex: If the input is:

1.5

the output is:

6.00

Ex: If the input is:

2.2

the output is:

8.80

Your program must define and call the following function:
def miles_to_laps(user_miles)
