6.17 Engineering examples

This section contains some examples of functions used to carry out engineering-type calculations.
Example: Gas equation

An equation used in physics and chemistry that relates pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas is PV = nRT. P is the pressure, V the volume, T the temperature, n the number of moles, and R a constant. The function below outputs the temperature of a gas given the other values.
Figure 6.17.1: PV = nRT. Compute the temperature of a gas.

gas_constant = 8.3144621  # Joules / (mol*Kelvin)

def convert_to_temp(pressure, volume, mols):
    """Convert pressure, volume, and moles to a temperature"""
    return (pressure * volume) / (mols * gas_constant)

press = float(input('Enter pressure (in Pascals): '))
vol = float(input('Enter volume (in cubic meters): '))
mols = float(input('Enter number of moles: '))

print('Temperature = {:.2f} K'.format(convert_to_temp(press, vol, mols)))



Enter pressure (in Pascals): 2500
Enter volume (in cubic meters): 35.5
Enter number of moles: 18
Temperature = 593.01 K

participation activity
6.17.1: PV = nRT calculation.

Questions refer to convert_to_temp function above.
1)
Function convert_to_temp uses a rewritten form of PV = nRT to solve for T, namely T = PV/nR.
2)
Function convert_to_temp uses a global variable for the gas constant R.
3)
Function convert_to_pres() would likely return (temp * volume) / (mols * gas_constant).
Example: Trajectory of object on Earth

Common physics equations determine the x and y coordinates of a projectile object at any time, given the object's initial velocity and angle at time 0 with initial position x = 0 and y = 0. The equation for x is v * t * cos(a). The equation for y is v * t * sin(a) - 0.5 * g * t * t.

The program's code asks the user for the object's initial velocity, angle, and height (y position), and then prints the object's position for every second until the object's y position is no longer greater than 0 (meaning the object fell back to Earth).

participation activity
6.17.2: Projective location.

Questions refer to function trajectory above.
1)
trajectory() cannot return two values (for x and y), so instead returns a single tuple containing both x and y.
2)
The program could replace float() by int() without causing much change in computed values.
3)
Each iteration of the loop will see y_loc increase.
4)
Assuming the launch angle is less than 90 degrees, each iteration of the loop will see x_loc increase.
challenge activity
6.17.1: Function to compute gas volume.
Define a function compute_gas_volume that returns the volume of a gas given parameters pressure, temperature, and moles. Use the gas equation PV = nRT, where P is pressure in Pascals, V is volume in cubic meters, n is number of moles, R is the gas constant 8.3144621 ( J / (mol*K)), and T is temperature in Kelvin.

Sample output with inputs: 100.0 1.0 273.0

Gas volume: 22.698481533 m^3
