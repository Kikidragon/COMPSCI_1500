6.21 LAB: Convert to binary - functions

Write a program that takes in a positive integer as input, and outputs a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in binary. For an integer x, the algorithm is:

As long as x is greater than 0
   Output x % 2 (remainder is either 0 or 1)
   x = x // 2

Note: The above algorithm outputs the 0's and 1's in reverse order. You will need to write a second function to reverse the string.

Ex: If the input is:

6

the output is:

110

Your program must define and call the following two functions. The function integer_to_reverse_binary() should return a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in binary (in reverse). The function reverse_string() should return a string representing the input string in reverse.
def integer_to_reverse_binary(integer_value)
def reverse_string(input_string)
