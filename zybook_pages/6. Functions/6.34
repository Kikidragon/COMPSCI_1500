6.34 LAB: Max and min numbers

Write a program whose inputs are three integers, and whose outputs are the largest of the three values and the smallest of the three values.

Ex: If the input is:

7
15
3

the output is:

largest: 15
smallest: 3

Your program must define and call the following two functions. The function largest_number() should return the largest number of the three input values. The function smallest_number() should return the smallest number of the three input values.

largest_number(num1, num2, num3)
smallest_number(num1, num2, num3)

Note: DO NOT use max() and min().
