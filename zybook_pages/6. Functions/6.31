6.31 LAB: Count evens

Write a function count_evens() that has four integer parameters, and returns the count of parameters where the value is an even number (i.e. evenly divisible by 2).

Ex: If the four parameters are:

1
22
11
40

then the returned count will be:

2

Hint: Use the modulo operator % to determine if each number is even or odd.

Your program must define the function:
count_evens(num1, num2, num3, num4)
