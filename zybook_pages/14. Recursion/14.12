14.12 LAB: Output a linked list

Write a recursive function called print_list() that outputs the integer value of each node in a linked list. Function print_list() has one parameter, the head node of a list. The main program reads the size of the linked list, followed by the values in the list. Assume the linked list has at least 1 node.

Ex: If the input of the program is:

5
1
2
3
4
5

the output of the print_list() function is:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

Hint: Output the value of the current node, then call the print_list() function repeatedly until the end of the list is reached. Refer to the Node class to explore any available instance methods that can be used for implementing the print_list() function.
