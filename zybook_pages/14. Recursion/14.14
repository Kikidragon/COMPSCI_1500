14.14 LAB: Reverse a string

Write a recursive function called reverse_string() that takes in a string as parameter and returns the string in reversed order. The main function is provided to read a string from the user and call the reverse_string() function.

Ex: If the input of the program is:

Hello

the reverse_string() function returns and the program outputs:

Reverse of "Hello" is "olleH".

Ex: If the input of the program is:

Hello, world!

the reverse_string() function returns and the program outputs:

Reverse of "Hello, world!" is "!dlrow ,olleH".

Hint: Move the first character to the end of the returning string and pass the remaining sub-string to the next reverse_string() function call.
