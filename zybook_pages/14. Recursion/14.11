14.11 LAB: Drawing a right side up triangle

Write a recursive function called draw_triangle() that outputs lines of '*' to form a right side up isosceles triangle. Function draw_triangle() has one parameter, an integer representing the base length of the triangle. Assume the base length is always odd and less than 20. Output 9 spaces before the first '*' on the first line for correct formatting.

Hint: The number of '*' increases by 2 for every line drawn.

Ex: If the input of the program is:

3

the function draw_triangle() outputs:

         *
        ***

Ex: If the input of the program is:

19

the function draw_triangle() outputs:

         *
        ***
       *****
      *******
     *********
    ***********
   *************
  ***************
 *****************
*******************

Note: No space is output before the first '*' on the last line when the base length is 19.
