14.1 Recursive functions

A function may call other functions, including calling itself. A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. The following program illustrates.

14.1.1: A recursive function example.

def count_down(count):
    if count == 0:
        print('Go!')
    else:
        print(count)
        count_down(count-1)

count_down(2)


count_down()
count: 2
count_down()
count: 1
count_down()
count: 0
2
1
Go!

    count_down is called and count = 2.
    count_down is recursively called and count = 1.
    count_down is recursively called and count = 0.

The function is mostly useful for demonstrating recursion; counting down is easily done instead of using a loop. Each call to count_down creates a new namespace for the local scope of the function. The script makes the first call to count_down(), creating a namespace with the count argument bound to the integer value 2. That first function call prints 2, and calls count_down() with an argument of 1. A new namespace is created again for the local variables in count_down()'s local scope with the count argument bound to the integer value 1. That second function call prints 1, and calls count_down() with an argument of 0. That third function call prints GO!, and then because count == 0 is true, returns. The second function call is then done so it returns. The first function call is then done so it returns. Finally, the script finishes.

14.1.2: Recursive functions.
1)
How many times is count_down() called if the script calls count_down(5)?

2)
How many times is count_down() called if the script calls count_down(0)?

3)
Is there a difference in how we define the parameters of a recursive versus non-recursive function? Answer yes or no.
