4.2 Detecting equal values with branches
Detecting if two items are equal using an if statement

A program commonly needs to determine if two items are equal. Ex: If a hotel gives a discount for guests on their 50th wedding anniversary, a program to calculate the discount can check if a variable numYears is equal to the value 50. A programmer can use an if statement to check if two values are equal.

An if statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true. The statements in a branch must be indented some number of spaces, typically four spaces.

The example below uses ==. The equality operator (==) evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal. Ex: If numYears is 50, then numYears == 50 evaluates to true. Note the equality operator is ==, not =.

num_years = int(input('Enter years married: '))


hotel_rate = 150;


if num_years == 50:


print('Your hotel rate:', hotel_rate)


50

hotel_rate = 150

num_years = int(input('Enter years married: '))

if num_years == 50:
    print('Congratulations on 50 years of marriage!')
    hotel_rate = hotel_rate / 2

print('Your hotel rate:', hotel_rate)


print('Congratulations on 50 years of marriage!')
hotel_rate = hotel_rate/2;

    An if statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true. The program assigns hotel_rate with 150 and then gets the number of years the user has been married from input.
    num_years is 50. So the expression num_years == 50 evaluates to true, and the if's statement will execute. The statements after the colon : will execute next.
    hotel_rate is divided in half, which is the discount for guests celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.
    The program completes by printing the hotel rate.

Equality and inequality operators

Whereas the equality operator checks whether two values are equal, the inequality operator (!=) evaluates to true if the left and right sides are not equal, or different.

An expression involving an equality or inequality operator evaluates to a Boolean value. A Boolean is a type that has just two values: True or False.
Table 4.2.1: Equality and inequality operators.
Equality operators 	Description 	Example (assume x is 3)
== 	a == b means a is equal to b 	x == 3 is True
x == 4 is False
!= 	a != b means a is not equal to b 	x != 3 is False
x != 4 is True

Type the operator to complete the desired expression.

2)
num_dogs and num_cats are the same

num_dogs  num_cats

3)
num_dogs and num_cats differ

num_dogs  num_cats

4)
num_dogs is either less than or greater than num_cats

num_dogs  num_cats

5)
user_char is the character 'x'.

user_char  'x'

If-else statement

An if-else statement executes one group of statements when an expression is true, and another group of statements when the expression is false. In the example below, the if-else statement outputs if a number entered by the user is even or odd. The if statement executes if divRemainder is equal to 0, and the else statement executes if divRemainder is not equal to 0.

    An if-else statement executes a group of statements if an expression is True, and executes another group of statements otherwise.
    user_num % 2 evaluates to the remainder of dividing user_num by 2. user_num is 22, so div_remainder is assigned with 0.
    The if statement's expression div_remainder == 0 evaluates to 0 == 0, which is True. So the if's statements execute.
    user_num is 45, so div_remainder is assigned with 1. The if statement's expression div_remainder == 0 evaluates to 1 == 0, which is False. So the else's statements execute.

Multi-branch if-else statements

Commonly, a program may need to detect several specific values of a variable. An if-else statement can be extended to have three (or more) branches. Each branch's expression is checked in sequence. As soon as one branch's expression is found to be true, that branch's statement executes (and no subsequent branch is considered). If no expression is true, the else branch executes. The example below detects values of 1, 25, or 50 for variable num_years.
Figure 4.2.1: Multi-branch if-else statement. Only 1 branch will execute.

if expression1:
   # Statements that execute when expression1 is true
   # (first branch)
elif expression2:
   # Statements that execute when expression1 is false and expression2 is true
   # (second branch)
else:
   # Statements that execute when expression1 is false and expression2 is false
   # (third branch)

if num_years == 1:
